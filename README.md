## üïë Respect for planning: being late & absence

In case of **delay**, **absence** or **early leave** (planned or not), you will need to warn us.

In short here is what you do in any of the three cases above:

1. Send a message to your coach by mail (and perhaps Discord too)

**[Reminder](https://github.com/becodeorg/BeCode/blob/master/educationalcontract.md#sanctions)**:

- 2 unjustified occasions of being late or leaving early is seen as an absence
- 2 unjustified absences leads to a one-on-one conversation
- 6 unjustified absences leads to a termination of your contract with us {and the vdab} and results in you leaving this training permanently.
- If the absence rate (justified or not) exceeds 20%, BeCode may decide on the final exclusion of the learner.
