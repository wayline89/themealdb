# Classes

---

Imagine you must deal with some data representing cars. Each car has several attributes (like : brand, model, color) and also methods (`drive()`, `stop()`...) etc.

For three models here are the amount of code you will need :

```js
const civic = {
  brand: "Honda",
  model: "Civic",
  color: "Marine",
  drive: function () {
    console.log("vrum vrum");
  },
  stop: function () {
    console.log("Car was stopped");
  },
};

const clio = {
  brand: "Renault",
  model: "Clio",
  color: "Black",
  drive: function () {
    console.log("vrum vrum");
  },
  stop: function () {
    console.log("Car was stopped");
  },
};

const picanto = {
  brand: "Kia",
  model: "Picanto",
  color: "White",
  drive: function () {
    console.log("vrum vrum");
  },
  stop: function () {
    console.log("Car was stopped");
  },
};
```

And even if we already have a "Clio", If I want to deal with another clio with different color, there is yet another object :

```js
const clio = {
  brand: "Renault",
  model: "Clio",
  color: "Gold",
  drive: function () {
    console.log("vrum vrum");
  },
  stop: function () {
    console.log("Car was stopped");
  },
};
```

---

Writting all this code down is verbose. Fortunately, we can create a blueprint to generate as many objects we want from a template :

```js
class Car {}
```

There you go ! Your blueprint is created !

Now... if you do :

```js
const toyota = new Car();
```

`toyota` will be an... empty object.

Of course ! Your class doesn't contain anything. But at least it works.

Now we can try to populate this class (object template).

There is such a thing as a `constructor` function that must be placed inside the declaration of a class.

This function will be fired each time we instanciate a new object from the class.

Inside this function, we can take parameters from the `new Car()` operation and assign them to the newly created object.

```js
class Car {
  constructor(param1, param2) {
    console.log("I run as soon as an object is created");
    console.log(param1);
    console.log(param2);
  }
}

const toyota = new Car("Hello", "World");
```

What do you expect will happen ?
Look at your console ;)

Indeed, the parameters we passed in the operation of creating a new Car are received by the `constructor` function.

We can now assign them to properties of the object.

But in order to do that, we need to understand the keyword `this`

`this`, in a class, refers to the object that will be created.

So...

```js
class Car {
  constructor(param1, param2) {
    this.myKey = param1;
    this.myKey2 = param2;
  }
}
```

What we are saying here is :

- Take the `param1` I provided when a instantiated a new object and assign it to the key `myKey`
- Same thing for `param2`

So if we do a :

```js
const toyota = new Car("hello", "world");
```

the expected result is an object as such :

```
{
    myKey: "Hello"
    myKey2: "World"
}
```

---

We can go further ! If we create other functions inside of the class, they will be methods of the newly created objects :

```js
class Car {
  constructor(brand, model, color) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
  }

  drive() {
    console.log("vrum vrum");
  }

  stop() {
    console.log("car has stopped");
  }
}
```

See what we did ?
We just created a class for a car the way it was in the beggining of this article.

Now, after preparing the class, we just have to instanciate it for each car we want !

```js
const honda = new Car("Honda", "Civic", "Marine");
const renault = new Car("Renault", "Clio", "Black");
const kia = new Car("Kia", "Picanto", "White");
```

In three lines of code we have 3 objects with all its particular characteristics and some shared methods.

Try for yourself !

There is more about classes. Like :

- the `bind` method for certain situations with the `this` keyword)
- the `extend` for extending a class from another.
- `static` and `public` values
  ...

OOP can be quite an abstract subject. As I told you, it's much more a methodology than a actual content to learn.

With this intro and the ressources provided, I hope you will be able to have a basic understanding of it if in the future you are asked to work on it.
