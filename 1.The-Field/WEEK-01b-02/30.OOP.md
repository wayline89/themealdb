Today, we are gonna start to study OOP !

**O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming

_OOP is a programming approach that focuses on objects and their interactions rather than procedural code with functions all over the place. It allows real concepts to be represented in source code using classes, objects and methods._

Well... not that easy to get, is it ?

Let's try to understand...

We could say there are three main programming paradigms : `procedural`, `functional` and `object oriented`.

A programming paradigm is a "**way of doing stuff** when programming". The way we approach our code.

Until now, we've been programming on JavaScript in the `procedural`/`functional` way of doing it. This means :

**Procedural**

- Writing sequential series of executions steps/tasks.

- Top to bottom code execution. Every time we need something we create it sequentially and run it.

**Functional**

- Organize code in (pure) functions with clearly defined tasks.

- Pass data around via parameters.

**OOP**

- Organize data and logic within objects (properties + methods)

- Organize code in logical entities

Let's try to understand these theee paradigms.

**Procedural**
"Write step by step instructions"

```js
let abc = 500;
if (abc < 1000) {
  abc = abc - 50;
}
```

Procedural code is very verbose. For **each** step of the program, we have to call a new piece of code.

Therefore, it's veeeery hard to _reuse_ code in this manner.

If we want to apply the same logic later, the only way is to copy and paste the piece of code.

It's a "no no"

**Functional**
"describe the logic using functions"

Relies very heavily on functions.

We describe our program in functions and call them when we need. It can be very easy to understand.

The names of the functions are often very explicit so we can call them later and be aware of what we are doing.

**OOP**
"hide logic within objects"

Here, everything is an object. It allows us to encapsulate a piece of data and logic inside an object.

In a bigger program, with hundreds of objects, if something breaks, we will only need to identify the object that is causing problem and fix it.

Think of `console.log`.

`log` is a method (function) that belongs to the object `console`.

We don't need to care about how the logic was implemented. All the logic is hidden inside the `console` object.

As the user, we only need to know that this function prints something in the console.

We won't be able to use the function `log` outside of its purpose. And we can reuse it as much as we want.

Another one is `localStorage.setItem()`

The `setItem` lives inside of the `localStorage` object. Its purpose is linked to the localStorage object and won't work outside of its scope.

By hidding the logic within objects, we can abstract away the complicated logic and just use it when we need.

Very often the amount of attributes and methods inside an object will be very huge, and many objects will must have the same attributes/methods.

That's why we use `classes`.

Classes are "blueprints" (models, templates) of objects. We can then create an infinite amount of objects from this blueprint (class) that will hold the same property keys and methods.
